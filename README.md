# Network Scanner - ARP-Based Network Discovery Tool

A lightweight Python network scanner that uses ARP requests to discover active devices on a local network.

## Features

- üïµÔ∏è Scan entire network ranges using CIDR notation
- üìü List all active devices with IP and MAC addresses
- üîç Simple and fast network discovery
- üìä Sorted results by IP address
- üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- scapy (`pip install scapy`)
- Root/Administrator privileges (for raw socket access)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AFT0ZERO/MAC_Address_Changer_Unix-Public
cd network-scanner
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
 ```bash
pip3 install scapy
```

## Usege
- Basic syntax:
```bash
sudo python3 scanner.py -r <network_range>
```
- Example:
  
```bash
  sudo python3 scanner.py -r 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
- Sample output:
```
[*] Scanning 192.168.1.0/24...

IP Address          MAC Address
-----------------------------------------
192.168.1.1         aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
192.168.1.15        00:11:22:33:44:55
192.168.1.100       ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa

[*] Found 3 devices.
```
## Options
    -r	Network range to scan (CIDR format)	192.168.1.0/24

## Troubleshooting
### common Issues:
 1. Permission Denied
    ```bash
    [!] Permission denied. Try running with sudo.
    ```
    - Solution: Run with sudo or administrator privileges

2. No Devices Found
   - Ensure devices are connected and powered on

   - Check your network connection

   - Verify firewall isn't blocking ARP requests
3. Invalid Network Range
    ```bash
    [!] Invalid network range: 192.168.1.500/24
    ```
    - Use valid CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24)

## How It Works
### This scanner uses:

- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to identify active devices

- Ethernet broadcast to send requests to all network devices

- Scapy for packet crafting and network communication
